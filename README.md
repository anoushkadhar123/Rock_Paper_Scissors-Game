# Rock_Paper_Scissors-Game
The Rock, Paper and Scissors Game is a two-person intransitive hand game in which each participant simultaneously produces one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These are the forms "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended in a V).
